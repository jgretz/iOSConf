Does your organization operate in a regulatory environment, such as FDA regulations? Does your project have non-functional requirements such as performance, scalability, security, or safety? Or are you just tired of mounting technical debt? If the answer to any of these questions is yes, or if you just want to improve product quality, find out how the Definition of Done can be used to address these problems. We faced these issues with many teams we coached and mentored: through trial-and-error, we have developed a multi-level application of the Definition of Done to address these issues: story-level, iteration level, and release level. Quantitative results will be presented to show how product quality improves and technical debt is reduced as the Definition of Done becomes more stringent. Real world examples of the application and evolution of a Definition of Done and the results achieved will be presented.\r\rI have used the multi-level Definition of Done to coach dozens of teams in several organizations to reach their stringent quality and compliance goals, including teams working in the security and FDA regulated environments. The real world examples I plan to use include both examples of what not to do, examples of what worked well (including empirical evidence to show that it worked well), as well as examples from scaled agile implementations with multiple, geographically distributed teams. I will start with some basics such as: What is Definition of Done? How is it different than User Story Acceptance Criteria? Why do we need multi-level Definitions of Done? How do you implement these?","length":"30","room":"Room 310","notes":null,"created":null,"modified":null,"active":"1","track_id":null},{"id":"3","title":"I Am a Front-End Web Dev (And So Can You!)","track":"JavaScript, Presentation","timeslot":"1:15 - 1:45","timeslot_id":"11","presenter":"Julie Pagano","presenter_id":"39","description":"Want to improve your front-end web development skills, but aren't sure where to start?

A functional language emphasizes functions as first class citizens like numbers and strings. However many languages do not offer a function syntactically simple as numbers or strings.  Convey experiments with making them very simple.\r\rIn addition to this there are a number of other non standard language elements that provide clean and concise code.  These include: consistent left to right data flow, white space for parenthesis, automatic quotes for string literals.\r         \rConvey is built on top of scala and receives it's functional power from scala and the powerful scala collection library.  This also provides access to the many scala and java libraries.

In a nutshell, this is a system where all of our devices communicate by routing through each other (sometimes referred to as a mesh network.) They trade information about the world and about which pieces of code work best and the amount of trust they have about others in the world. Using this information, they can make very educated decisions to promote the best, most correct code for your system over time. They can also share computation and answers to computational problems with others. This is very much the next generation and one possible direction for the current \"cloud\" infrastructures where control and power is distributed back to the hands of individual people.\r\rWith the goal being availability of code to every person on the planet, I will discuss the design, structure, and requirements most of which we already have developed. For instance, which network protocols we will use. What does the system model look like and how do people communicate? What might a typical device that we use look and act like?\r\rWhen the system is built, and to further the motivation, I will talk about the various benefits of such a system: a promotion of computation in the third world. This implies a further lowering of the barrier of entry to technology \/ making technology cheaper in both educational effort and monetary cost. Also, a novel approach to subverting censorship and central authority and governmental control over computation.\r\rNaturally, this system is not without fault or obstacle, so I also will spend time on the drawbacks or hurdles and ways to mitigate them: How do we trust others? How can we push this new model on a world that fears change? How do we make hardware cheap enough to distribute to lower wealth nations?","length":"60","room":"Room 310","notes":null,"created":null,"modified":null,"active":"1","track_id":null},{"id":"54","title":"Entity Framework Code-First Migrations","track":"Object Oriented Languages, Relational Database","timeslot":"9:15 - 10:15","timeslot_id":"17","presenter":"Sam Nasr","presenter_id":"51","description":"Code First Migrations allow for database changes to be implemented all through code.
